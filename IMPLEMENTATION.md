## Technical Highlights

### Reactive Architecture

- **Praxis reactive logic engine** for type-safe, testable state management
- Event-driven updates with typed events (`AddNodeEvent`, `UpdateNodeEvent`, etc.)
- Declarative rules for state transformations
- Svelte 5 runes for UI reactivity
- Terminal stdout → Praxis events → Display nodes (automatic)
- Input values → Praxis events → Connected nodes (reactive)
- No manual event wiring needed

### Modern Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte 5 + SvelteKit + TypeScript + Vite
- **State Management**: Praxis v1.2.0 reactive logic engine
- **Data Storage**: PluresDB v1.3.1 for P2P-enabled persistent storage
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri 2.x
- **Build**: Fast HMR development, optimized production builds
- **Cross-platform**: Single codebase → Windows, macOS, Linux

### Developer Experience

- TypeScript for type safety across state management and UI
- Praxis rules and events for better code organization
- Hot module replacement in dev mode
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testable state logic through Praxis engine

## What Works Right Now

Users can:

1. ✅ Launch the app (requires system dependencies)
2. ✅ Add terminal, input, transform, and display nodes
3. ✅ Drag nodes around the canvas
4. ✅ Execute shell commands in terminal nodes
5. ✅ See command output in terminal nodes
6. ✅ Enter data in input widgets
7. ✅ Transform data with map/filter/reduce operations
8. ✅ View data in display nodes
9. ✅ Load example canvases
10. ✅ Save canvases to browser storage
11. ✅ Load saved canvases from storage list
12. ✅ Export canvases as YAML files

## How to Use This Implementation

### For Users

1. Read `QUICKSTART.md` for a tutorial
2. Install system dependencies (see README.md)
3. Run `npm install && npm run tauri dev`
4. Start building canvas workflows

### For Developers

## Conclusion

RuneBook is now a functional, well-documented desktop application with a solid foundation for future development. The reactive canvas system works, terminals execute commands, data flows between nodes, and transform nodes enable data processing. The architecture is extensible, the code is clean and typed, and comprehensive documentation guides both users and developers.
