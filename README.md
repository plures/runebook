# runebook
RuneBook is a reactive, canvas-native computing environment that merges terminals, notebooks, and web components. Built on Svelte, PluresDB, Tauri, and Sudolang, RuneBook lets users wire terminals, inputs, and UI components on a visual canvas to create programmable, AI-enhanced workflows that behave like reactive web apps.
